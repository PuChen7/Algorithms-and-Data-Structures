# Trim a Binary Search Tree - from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
[View this problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as L and R, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [L, R] (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

# Solution 
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int L, int R) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        if (root.val > R) return trimBST(root.left, L, R);
        if (root.val < L) return trimBST(root.right, L, R);
        
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, L, R);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, L, R);
        return root;
    }
}
```
## Complexity
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n) - the call stack of our recursion could be as large as the number of nodes in the worst case.
