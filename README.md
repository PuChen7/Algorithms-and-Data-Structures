# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository is used for implementing algorithms by using different programming languages.

## Data Structures
This is a collection of data structures and algorithms which I learned in my academic life.
This summary is for further learning purpose.
All algorithms should be tested and 100% correct.

## Algorithm Problems
This is a collection of algorithm problems which can be taken as a preparation for coding interviews. 
All questions are picked out from various resources such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com). 
All problems are solved by using Java.
