# Backtracking

## Definition
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems. It simply tries all possible options recursively.

In each step, check if it satisfies all constraints. If it does, then continue. If it doesn't, then step backward to check another path. (The difference between Brute-Force and Backtracking)

## When to use backtracking

* Find a path to success

* Find all paths to success

* Find the best path to success

This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
